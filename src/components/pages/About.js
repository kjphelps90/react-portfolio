            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Kevin Phelps, I'm 31 years old from Ann Arbor, Michigan. I graduated from Western Michigan University in 2012 with a bachelors degree in Finance. Before attending this coding bootcamp I spent the last seven years working for a consulting company called CFI Group, holding several different positions over that time frame. I enjoy the process of coding and the problem solving that it requires. In my free time I enjoy hanging out with my wife and two dogs. I also enjoy watching Detroit based sports, playing golf, and playing any card game that I can find.</p>
